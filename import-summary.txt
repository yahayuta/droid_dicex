ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitattributes
* .gitignore
* release\
* release\droid_dicex
* release\droid_dicex.apk
* release\jp\
* release\jp\main.png
* release\jp\main1.png
* release\jp\main2.png
* release\jp\main3.png
* release\jp\main4.png
* release\main.png
* release\main1.png
* release\main2.png
* release\main3.png
* release\main4.png
* release\main5.png
* release\menu6.png
* release\six.png

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => app\src\main\assets
* libs\afreechart-0.0.3.jar => app\libs\afreechart-0.0.3.jar
* lint.xml => app\lint.xml
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
